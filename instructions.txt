Instructions

Before doing anything else, make sure the network works in your configuration. If you try to set up mining before you can access the Internet, you'll set things up halfway and have problems. When running for the first time, the mining configuration script downloads necessary packages from the Debian repositories for the miner's auto-configuration and therefore it will be necessary to have access to the Internet.

We recommend using a wired network, which automatically configures itself at startup. If wireless access is required, go to Menu (bottom left), Net Manager -> Wireless tab -> activate the switch and configure according to your access point.

About setting up the mining itself

After configuring the network, paste your wallet on the first line of the file located in the path /root/wallet.txt. You can get it from any cloud on the Internet (use Chromium Browser, based on Chrome, which comes pre-installed). Or from your HD on the same PC/Notebook, or from another pendrive with it recorded. In fact, you can even paste it into a text file inside MineCore's own flash drive. To do this, locate the device (whatever it is) by opening the file manager and opening the device (sdaX, sdbX, sdcX...). It must be in the /media/ folder.

When locating your text file with wallet, open as text (right mouse button) -> open with -> accessories -> Text editor

After connecting to the internet and configuring the wallet.txt, double CLICK on the start.sh file and choose the first option (Run) for the configuration to begin. Follow the instructions.

If all goes well, you will have a system set up, but you will need to do the first calibration. To do this, click on minerar.sh (double click). If nothing happens, it's apparently because the mining is somehow already running in the background. The system is designed to avoid this behavior (which can be configured later), but sometimes it insists on remaining in the background. If this is your case, open the terminal (in the slash) and type in THIS order the following commands:

systemctl stop moneroocean_miner <enter>
killall xmlrig <enter>
systemctl disable moneroocean_miner <enter>

After running "minerar.sh" it will calibrate the machine and continue normally.
Settings in Slax-based MineCore are natively persistent, so you just need to re-run "minerar.sh" the next time you restart your computer.

It is also possible to configure mining to automatically start in the background on the next boot. To do this, close the "minerar.sh" mining window, open a terminal window and run the following commands:

systemctl enable moneroocean_miner <enter>
systemctl start moneroocean_miner <enter>

Ready. The miner will already be running in the background. Whenever you want to see the Mineror message window, you will need to use the following command in the terminal:

journalctl -u moneroocean_miner -f

Ready! Welcome to the world of Monero mining using CPU.

MineCore is a simple system, based on minimal Linux distributions to run on machines of all sizes with low consumption of hardware resources and simple to use shell scripts. The purpose is didactic, introducing you to the world of mining. If you can collaborate with the development of the system, you can help by contributing to code improvements, promoting the minecore.live website or donating pickers to the wallet:
